------------------------SAT-based approaches to treewidth computation----------------------

This package includes:
	1) A DGG to WCNF script that converts graph files in DGF format to MaxSAT instances (.wcnf files) for which 
	   the optimal cost of the MaxSAT instance is equal to the treewidth of the graph. The script uses the encoding described in 
	   [1]. 	  
	2) A modified version of the minisat 2.2.0 SAT solver that reads the WCNF files corresponding to treewidth computation 
	   and solves the instance using one of the three search strategies detailed in [1]		


USAGE:
	DGF2WCNF:
		The script is written in Haskell and tested with ghc 7.6.3 under linux
		package includes a precompiled binary linked both statically and dynamically. 
		The script can be built by using the build script in the DGF2WCNF folder. 
		
		After building the binary expects one command line argument 
		./DGF2WCNF_TW_linux FILE.dgf
				
		where FILE.dgg is the input graph. 
		The script produces the file FILE.wcnf which contains a MaxSAT instance that has optimal cost equal to 
		the treewidth of the input graph. The ".wcnf" file can be given to any MaxSAT solver, which results in the 
		MaxSAT approachdescribed in {1]. Alternatively the ".wcnf" file can be input to the minisat-treewidth hack found in 
		this package, which results in the approaches Iter-Lin-U, Iter-Lin-D or Iter-Bin of {1].    

	minisat-treewidth: 
		The binary accepts a ".wcnf" corresponding to the treewidht encoding as described in [1]. 
		It also accepts the same flags as the regular minisat solver (invoke ./minisat-treewidth --help for more info) 
		as well as the flag --search that controls the search strategy.
		
		Examples:
			./minisat-treewidth --search=1 FILE.wcnf invokes the Iter-Bin search strategy (this is the default setting)
			./minisat-treewidth --search=2 FILE.wcnf invokes the Iter-Lin-U search strategy  
			./minisat-treewidth --search=3 FILE.wcnf invokes the Iter-Lin-D search strategy 

DGF Files:
	The package includes example dgf files.
